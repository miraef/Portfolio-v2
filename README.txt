About No Name Yet variable font
-------------------------------

A variable typeface that aims to experiment with the definition of legibility, between a conventional alphabet and abstract signs. The typeface blurs the edge of legibility, creating a familiar but also abstract impression that gives the font a unique character. It combines a conventional legible typeface (Open Sans Regular) and three forms of abstraction, which are Geometric, Mimetic, and Linear.
