                Mechanical men - journal nr.4
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                A small group of people have gathered in a dark room, high up in the central fort. 
                Very few know about this meeting and with good reason. 
                The king will say it is to not give the people unfounded hope before this unconventional solution has been thoroughly discussed. 
            <br>The group consists of King Malt, his brother and right hand Kistant Malt, seer Fauwn, and a messenger here on behalf of a previously unknown construct wizard. 
                He has brought with him a mechanical man. Despite its given name, it barely resembles any humanoid the group has seen.

        <br><br>"Heron, what do you think?"
            <br>"Honestly, I am unsure. I have a few questions for you, messenger. How is it animated?"
            <br>"A curse, seer"
            <br>"A curse? Perpetual? Is it stable? Predictable?"   
            <br>Heron asks simple questions with such an intensity it feels like she's trying to slice open the messengers skin, 
                looking for the truth in between the flaps of meat and blood. 
                She has no reason yet to believe the messenger is lying, but she likes to be preemptive. 
            <br>"I understand your apprehension seer, but I can assure you the curse has been studied and tested extensively. 
                There's no possible additional or adverse reaction. It simply grants the constructs with a very simple level of intelligence, 
                similar to that of a cat, less than a dog and it lacks free will completely"

            <br>The messenger hands the king what seems to be a looking glass. He instinctively shoots a quick glance to his seer, 
                not too unlike a child looking to his guardian for approval before accepting a gift. It's quick enough he can tell himself no one noticed. 

            <br>"King, extend it and speak your command through it"
            <br>King Malt takes the contraption in both hands, cautiously extending it. It scrapes and snaps sharply, but slides smoothly. 
                He raises it to his mouth and sifts a whisper through an expectant smile;
            <br>"Kneel"
            <br>The mechanical man that had up until now stood completely lifeless, now without a single beat, kneels. 
                Its calculated, intentional, like the thing had been expecting it while they were talking, preparing for it, deciding on the perfect, 
                most effective way for its strange, bent body to kneel. The part of its body it has decided is its knee, 
                barely makes a sound as it hits the rough wood floor. 
                <br>The fort is close to ancient. You could hold a conversation, one man at the top and one at the bottom of this tower, 
                only communicating through the creaking of the floorboards, but its as if this thing has accounted for exactly that. 
                A kneel won't win a war of course, or protect a city, but this simple kneel somehow conveys the immense strength hidden within this construct of seemingly unintentional shapes and almost organic metal. 

            <br>"How will it die?" King Malt doesn't look at Heron, he is spellbound by the thing kneeling in front of him. Heron doesn't look at Malt. She walks slowly around the thing, studying every angle carefully with both curiosity and purpose. 
            <br>"...I can't see"
            <br>"You can't see? Doesn't that mean it wont die?"
            <br>"There is a chance, yes" Her words sound positive, her tone conveys her hesitance. King Johant Malt chooses to not consider her tone. 
            <br>"I'll take that chance"
